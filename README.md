# 🎸 Optimal Musical Fingering

**Optimize chord fingerings and transitions for neck instruments like guitar, ukulele, and more.**

---

## 🎯 Objective

Imagine being able to translate any song into an optimized tablature or partiture, with ideal finger positions chosen automatically. This project aims to make that a reality by calculating **the most efficient and ergonomic placement of fingers on the instrument's neck** for any chord or sequence of chords, for instruments like guitar, ukulele, bass, banjo and others with a similar fretboard layout.

Whether you're practicing or composing, _Optimal Musical Fingering_ helps you play smarter, not harder.
